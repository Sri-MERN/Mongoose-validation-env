# Mongoose-validation-env
Validation crud on mongoose and adding env

Mongoose crud with validation and env  - File structure is very important to understand the concepts,

1.create root index.js then new folder routes withinit two new files,as index.js and user.js,

2.Then packages required are npm i Mongoose,express,mongodb,dotenv

3.configure the db within newfile as dbconfig.js then db name and url, add env file withinit assign port,
  and our dbUrl,

4.For validation add new folder schema then fileas UserSchema.js within it add required validation regux,
   we can also set our own validation

(Things to note in all required places add Mongoose,route properly and crud on Mongoose slight different
from mongodb previous verify express-mongo in repo.)
